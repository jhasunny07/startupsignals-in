Building something people want is hard.

But getting people to actually use it? That’s usually **much harder**.

After burning through 18 months and a decent chunk of savings on my first SaaS, here’s the lesson that hurt the most:

**Distribution beats product 80% of the time in the early days.**

### Why Product People Hate Hearing This

We love building. We optimize onboarding, reduce friction, A/B test CTAs… meanwhile our MRR sits at $342/month for six straight months.

The truth is brutal: a mediocre product with great distribution almost always wins over a perfect product with zero distribution.

### What Actually Moved the Needle (in order)

1. **Cold outbound that didn’t feel cold** — personalized Loom videos to 300 ICPs
2. **One viral LinkedIn thread** (12k impressions → 47 signups)
3. **Partnerships with 2 newsletters** (not huge, but trusted)
4. **Fixing the product second** — only after we had paying users screaming for features

Moral: Stop polishing until someone is willing to pay for the unpolished version.
