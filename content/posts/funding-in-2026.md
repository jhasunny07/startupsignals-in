Short version: It’s tougher than 2021–2022, but far from impossible — if you know where the money actually is.

Key changes I’m seeing in early 2026:

- Pre-seed rounds: $300k–$800k more common than $1.5M+
- Lead investors want ≥ 20–25% traction metrics before writing checks
- Angels & micro-VCs are doing 70%+ of the early deals
- Revenue > story > team (reversal from 2020 playbook)
